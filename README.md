## Planning and Development

My plan was as follows:

1. Brain storming and wireframe design.
2. Front-end: XML design in Android Studio.
3. Back-end:
    - Firebase.
    - Mock API
    - Functionality implementation.
4. Testing

### Problem solving strategy:

I mostly solve the problems in the following order:

1. Identify the problem
2. Debugging the code
3. Search about the error (Google, Stackoverflow)
4. Ask the experts
